# Energy_Demand_Forecast
This was a program organised between Enapsys Ltd. and Teesside University. The proposed project was at the heart of Enapsys's current consulting endeavours.
The business problem assigned was centred around the electricity demand of France, which was a major driver of European electricity prices. Therefore, France is likely to import from its neighbours during times of high demand, which will raise energy prices, and export during times of low demand, which will do the opposite, lowering energy prices. As a result, Enapsys has a pressing need to develop solid insight to anticipate these demands to help companies like Shell, eDF and Centrica in making informed business plans.
The following approach was implemented in the execution of the project.
•	Data collection, cleaning, and data pre-pre-processing
•	Insight analysis of France's energy demand historical data: The peak periods and low demand periods were identified through trends, the impact of other phenomena such as holiday and weekends were identified.
•	Test phase one: In this step just before feature engineering, Linear models were implemented to further understand the impact of the selected features which proved helpful in creating new features.
•	Feature Engineering: Features were tested for correlation and were also created to further improve the model accuracy.
•	Test phase two: In this phase, machine learning models were used to better understand the created features and as well set the foundation for building the deep learning models.
•	Test phase three: Two deep learning models were tested and the most optimal (Convolutional Neural Network) was agreed to be used.
•	The key highlight of this model is its accuracy to Forecast France’s Energy price (1 hour, 24 hours, and 48 hours ahead)
