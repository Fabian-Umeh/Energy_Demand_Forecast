# Energy_Demand_Forecast
Key functionality and highlights:  The created Machine learning model is useful in planning daily energy producing operations,  balancing demand with adequate supply, thus fulfil Frances’ energy demands, and finally  prevent generation of excess energy.  The model is structured to make predictions two days ahead. With a MAPE of 1.47% and  Accuracy of ~94% CNN  CNN, MLP, RF, KNN and LR has been used for both prediction and Forecast. RF and LR  produced and accuracy of 99% for one hour ahead prediction and MLP an accuracy of ~93%  for two days ahead forecast.
